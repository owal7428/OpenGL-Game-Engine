How to use:
     
    -When in first person view: Use W,A,S,D to move and arrow keys to look up/down and left/right.
    
    -Press m to change viewing mode.
    
    -Press space to toggle whether or not player collision box visualization should follow player.
     Note: this is not the actual collision box, just a visual representation.
    
    -When in the second scene, move towards the plane to trigger collision. Use the collision box
     visualization to verify collision is working.
    
    -Press o to change scene currently looking at.
    
    -Press ESC to exit the program.

Remaining work to do:

    -Edge to edge collision needs to be tested.

    -Collision response needs to be implemented.

    -Player movement including jump as well as mouse based looking.

    -Basic level to move around in.
